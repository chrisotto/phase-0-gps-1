What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
*Prior to this session I was struggling with concepts surrounding pushing a repo to GitHub and with pull requests in GitHub.
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
*The above concepts were clarified. I know feel like I can more clearly define and use pull requests in Github.
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
*I asked them about the difference between add and commit when it comes to staging files in git.
What still confuses you about Git?
*I am still a little confused about fetching and merging. I am not too sure how it is different from push.
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
*It lasted a lot longer than I had thought, but I was glad that we had enough time to actually take our time getting deep into the topic and stopping when we needed clarification.
