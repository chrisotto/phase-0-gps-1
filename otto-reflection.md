* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
    It still feels to me like pulling and pushing should be replacing, not merging.  But I'm getting used to the concept.
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
    I understand better how merge conflicts work.
* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
    We asked a lot of clarification questions about what we were doing and why as we were working through the exercises.
* What still confuses you about Git?
    When you use fetch, there seems to be a "ghost" repository with branches that match the origin but aren't active branches locally.
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
    Pretty good.  It really felt like all three of us were having a discussion about the topic at hand.  My first two pairing sessions and this one have all run almost 2 hours, so I think the GPS should allot more time to the session.
